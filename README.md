Awesome list of Free and Open Source game engines recreations and helper tools. All engines at this list are stable and provides fully playable gameplay. I keep this list mostly as own bookmarks and game history research file. All projects work well at Arch Linux at the time of the last edit.


* [Fallout Community Edition](https://github.com/alexbatalov/fallout1-ce) - best to start playing with a minimal files set:

```
critter.dat
master.dat
patch000.dat
sound/music/
```

Otherwise you can catch the "unable to save game" issue.


* [Fallout 2 Community Edition](https://github.com/alexbatalov/fallout2-ce) - supports sfall improvements, also Nevada and Sonora. As developer says, "[Fallout 2 Restoration Project](https://github.com/phobos2077/Fallout2_Restoration_Project), Fallout Et Tu and Olympus 2207 are not yet supported".  
As for the original Fallout 2, best to start playing with a minimal files set:

```
critter.dat
master.dat
patch000.dat
sound/music/
```

* [GemRB](https://gemrb.org) - implements Infinity Engine to play Baldurâ€™s Gate 1, 2, Icewind Dale 1 and Planescape: Torment (NOT ENHANCED VERSIONS).

* [GZDoom](https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom) - modder-friendly OpenGL and Vulkan source port based on the DOOM engine. Support the classical DOOMs, mods, and total conversions.

* [innoextract](https://github.com/dscharrer/innoextract) - tool for game data extraction from GOG installers. Example of the usage:

```innoextract filename.exe -I app```



* [OpenJK](https://github.com/JACoders/OpenJK) - can play Jedi Academy and Jedi Outcast (of Raven Software).

* [OpenMW](https://openmw.org) - allow you to play Morrowind (using the original game data) with mods. Look also at [Tamriel Rebuilt](https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org) mod that adds Morrowind's mainland, full of new adventures. 

* [Raze](https://github.com/ZDoom/Raze) - Build/ZDoom engine to play Bood, Duke Nukem 3D, Redneck Rampage, Shadow Warrior, Exhumed/Powerslave, Nam and WW2 GI. Look and feel of the original games, CPU load friendly (so Raze/Blood loads CPU less than Dosbox/Blood). [Raze official site](https://raze.zdoom.org/about)

* [ScummVM](https://www.scummvm.org) - multi-engine for point'n'click adventures. Supports famouns serios of LucasArts, Sierra On-Line, Westwood Studios, etc. If you have joypad plugged-in, the mouse cursor will move to the top left corner eternally, so you can cheat by run with non-existent joypad: ```scummvm --joystick=1``` (zero - 0 - is the default joystick).

* [The Force Engine](https://theforceengine.github.io) - modern engine for STAR WARS: Dark Forces and mods.
